  • The dimensions of bot at the start of the game should not exceed 25cm x 25cm x 25cm .In other  words, each of the robots should completely fit within a box having respective dimensions.  
  • The weight of the robot should not exceed 5 kg. The remote control (wireless/wired), batteries etc.  all of which is to be included in the weight.  
  • The potential difference between any two points in the robot should not exceed 12V at any point  of time during the match.  
  • Teams will be provided a power supply (220V AC supply) on the arena, teams have to bring their  own adapters (for 12V-2A power supply).
